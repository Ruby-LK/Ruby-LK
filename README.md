# Hi there, I'm Ruby! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸŒŸ I'm passionate about coding, problem-solving, and creating meaningful projects. Here's a little bit about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on honing my coding skills and exploring new technologies.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m constantly learning and expanding my knowledge in the world of fivem server development. [Ik this looks stupid]
- âš¡ Fun fact: I believe that coding errors are opportunities to learn and grow. Embracing challenges is my motto!
