# Hi there, I'm Ruby! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸŒŸ I'm passionate about coding, problem-solving, and creating meaningful projects. Here's a little bit about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on honing my coding skills and exploring new technologies.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m constantly learning and expanding my knowledge in the world of fivem server development. [Ik this looks stupid]
- âš¡ Fun fact: I believe that coding errors are opportunities to learn and grow. Embracing challenges is my motto!

Feel free to reach out to me if you want to collaborate, have questions, or just want to chat about coding and technology. Let's connect and learn from each other! ðŸ˜Š
